# Analyzing Canadian demographic and housing data using R

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

We have built up an open source ecosystem of R packages for ingesting and analyzing Canadian data, greatly facilitating our ability to efficiently work with Canadian housing, economic and demographic data. While we have regularly given workshops to help others become familiar with these methods, we have never given a thorough introduction to a broader audience of how to leverage this ecosystem for collaborative data analysis.

This book project aims to fill this gap by targeting non-experts, journalists, community groups and activists, and policy makers that have questions that could be answered by Canadian data, but lack the tools or expertise to do so themselves.

The book takes a project based approach, using (hypothetical) questions and use cases to show how to answer their question through Canadian data, successively using more complex data and teaching more complex data processing and analysis techniques along the way.

This repository contains all the code and text for the book, a readable web version can be found on the [associated GitHub pages site](https://mountainmath.github.io/canadian_data/).
