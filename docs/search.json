    "title": "Analyzing Candian demographic and housing data using R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This book is intended for people interested in learning how to access, process, analyze, and visualize Canadian demographic, economic, and housing data using R. The target audience we have in mind ranges from interested individuals interested in understanding their environment through data, community activists and community groups interested in introducing data-based approached into their work, journalists who want to report on data in their stories or aim to incorporate their own descriptive data analysis, non-profits or people involved in policy who are looking for data-based answers to their questions.\nThe most important prerequisite is a keen interest in using data to help understand how housing and demographics shape cities and rural areas in Canada, and a willingness to learn. Prior knowledge of R is not necessary, but may be beneficial.\nCanada has high quality demographic, economic and housing data. While significant data gaps exist, the available data often remains under-utilized in policy and planning analyses. Moreover, many analyses that do come out go quickly out of date and can’t easily be updated because they rely on non-reproducible and non-adaptable workflows.\nIn this book we will maintain a strong emphasis on reproducible and adaptable work flows to ensure the analysis is transparent, can easily be updated as new data becomes available, and can be tweaked or adapted to address related questions.\n\n\nThis book will take a project based approach to to teach through examples, with one project per section. Each project will be loosely broken up into four parts.\n\nFormulating the question. What is the question we are interested in? Asking a clear question will help focus our efforts and ensure that we don’t aimlessly trawl through data.\nIdentifying possible data sources. Here we try to identify data sources that can speak to our question. We will also take the time to read up on definitions and background concepts to better understand the data and prepare us for data analysis.\nData acquisition. In this step we will import the data into our current working session. This could be as simple as an API call, or more complicated like scraping we table from the web, or involve even more complex techniques to acquire the data.\nData preparation. In this step we will reshape and filter the data to prepare it for analysis.\nAnalysis. This step could be as simple as computing percentages or even doing nothing, is the quantities we are interested in already come with the dataset, if our question can be answered by a simple descriptive analysis. In other cases, when our question is more complex, this step may be much more involved. The book will try to slowly build up analysis skills along the way, with increasing complexity of questions and required analysis.\nVisualization. The final step is to visualize and communicate the results. In some cases this can be done via a table or a couple of paragraphs of text explaining the results, but in most cases it is useful to produce graphs or maps or even interactive visualizations to effectively communicate the results.\n\nWhile we won’t always follow this step by step process to the letter, it will be our guiding principle throughout the book. Sometimes things won’t go so clean, where after the visualization step we notice that something looks off or is unexpected, and we may jump back up a couple of steps and add more data and redo parts of the analysis to better understand our data and how it speaks to our initial questions. We might even come to understand that our initial question was not helpful or was ill-posed, and we will come back to refine it.\n\n\n\nBy taking this approach we have several goals in mind:\n\nStay motivated by using real world Canada-focused and (hopefully) interesting examples.\nTeach basic data literacy, appreciate definitions and quirks in the data.\nExpose the world of Canadian data and make it more accessible.\nLearn how data can be interpreted in different ways, and data and analysis is not necessarily “neutral”.\nLearn how to effectively communicate results.\nLearn how to adapt and leverage off of previous work to answer new questions.\nLearn how to reproduce and critique data analysis.\nBuild a community around Canadian data, where people interested in similar questions, or people using the same data, can learn from each other.\nRaise the level of understanding of Canadian data and data analysis so we are better equipped to tackle the problems Canada faces.\n\nThis is setting a very high goal for this book, and we are not sure we can achieve all of this. But we will try our best to be accessible and interesting as possible.\n\n\n\nMost people reading this book will not have used R before, or only used it peripherally, maybe during a college course many years in the past. Instead, readers may be familiar with working through housing and demographic data in Excel or similar tools. Or making maps in QGIS or similar tools when dealing with spatial data. And the type of analysis outlined above that this book will teach can in general terms be accomplished using these tools.\nBut where tools like spreadsheets and desktop GIS fall short is in another important focus of this book: transparency, reproducibility, and adaptability.\nAn analysis in a spreadsheet or desktop GIS typically involves a lot of manual steps, the work is not reproducible without repeating these steps. We can’t easily inspect how the result was derived, the analysis lacks transparency. When we just compute a ratio or percentage this may not be so bad, but trying to understand how a more complex analysis was done in a spreadsheet easily turns into a nightmare. Analysis that involves a lot of manual steps is not auditable without putting in the work to repeat those manual steps.\nBut why does this matter? It’s always been this way, some experts produce analysis and produce a glossy paper to present the results. One can argue if this was an adequate modus operandi in the past, but we feel strongly that it’s not in today’s world. The lines between experts and non-experts has become blurred, and the value we place on lived experience has increased relative to more formal expertise. We argue this places different demands on policy-relevant analysis, it needs to be open and transparent, in principle anyone should be able to understand how the analysis was done and the conclusions were reached. That’s where reproducibility and transparency come in. And it also requires bringing up data analysis skills in the broader population, so that the ability to reproduce and critique an analysis in principle can be realized in practice.\nThe remaining reason for using R, adaptability, has also become increasingly important. The amount of data available to us has increased tremendously, but our collective ability to analyse data and extract information has not kept up. Doing analysis in R allows us to efficiently reuse previous analysis to perform a similar one. Or to build on previous analysis to deepen it. Which turbocharges our ability to do analysis, covering more ground and going deeper.\nR is not the only framework to do this in, there are other options like python or julia. But we believe that R is best suited for people transitioning into this space, and we can rely on an existing ecosystem of packages to access and process Canadian data. People already proficient in python will have no problem translating what we do into their preferred framework, or dynamically switch back and forth between R, python or whatever other tools they prefer as needed and convenient.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to our most ambitious goal, to help create a community around Canadian data analysis. When analysis is transparent, reproducible and adaptable people can piggy-back of each other’s work, reusing parts of analysis others have done and building and improving upon it. Or Critiquing and correcting analysis, or taking it toward a different direction. A community that grows in their understanding of data, and a community using a shared set of tools to access and process Canadian data, enabling discussions to move forward instead of in circles. A community that builds up expertise from the bottom up.\nThe book tries to address both of these requirements for building a Canadian data community, a principled approach to data and data analysis, while introducing R as a common framework to work in hoping that the reader will come away with\n\nbetter data literacy skills to understand and critique data analysis,\ntechnical skills to reproduce and perform their own data analysis, and\na common tool set for acquiring, processing and analyzing Canadian data that facilitates collaborative practices."

People probably grasp the importance of having a principled approach to data analysis, from formulating a question all the way to sharing results. But why so much emphasis on reproducibility and adaptability? And do we really need to learn a new framework like R for this?\nThis is best understood by walking through a simple example of what analysis of Canadian data in R, and a Canadian data community might look like. We won’t explain all steps in full detail here, this is to serve to illustrate the concepts talked above in the preface and give the reader a taste of what’s to come."

    "section": "1.1 A hypothetical example",
    "text": "1.1 A hypothetical example\nImagine Amy, a Toronto-based social services worker looking to pilot a community intervention targeted at children in low income. She is in the process of putting together a proposal describing her intervention and is trying to locate a good neighbourhood for her pilot and make a compelling case to possible funders.\nAmy knows that census data has a good geographic breakdown of children in poverty, but the latest available data is from 2016, using 2015 income data. CRA tax data is available up to 2019, but also has information on families in low income, but nothing directly on children in the standard release tables at fine geographies. As a first step she settles on census data, with the goal to re-run the analysis once the 2021 data comes out later in the year.\nShe refers to the Census Dictionary to understand the various low income measures, and uses CensusMapper’s interactive map that allows to explore these concepts. She would have liked to use the Market Based Measure, but due to data availability she settles for LICO-AT.\nShe sets up a new Notebook and loads in the R libraries that she will need for this, ggplot2for graphing and cancensus for ingesting the data.\n\nlibrary(cancensus)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNext she pull in the data. the CensusMapper API GUI tool helps her locate the StatCan geographic identifier for Toronto, (3520005), and the internal CensusMapper vector for the percentage of children in LICO-AT (v_CA16_2573).\n\nlico_yyz <- get_census(\"CA16\",regions=list(CSD=\"3520005\"), vectors=c(lico=\"v_CA16_2573\"),\n                        level=\"CT\",geo_format=\"sf\", quiet=TRUE)\n\nHere Amy specified that she wants data for the 2016 Canadian census (“CA16”), the region and vectors, at the census tract (“CT”) level, with geographies as well as the low income data.\nNow that she has the data at her finger times her first step is to make a map. For that she needs to tell ggplot is what variable to use as fill colour, and maybe give it a nicer colour scale and some labels to explain what the map is about.\n\nggplot(lico_yyz, aes(fill=(lico/100))) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels=scales::percent) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Children in low income (LICO-AT)\",\n       fill=\"Share\",\n       caption=\"StatCan census 2016\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on this she locates a couple of good candidate neighbourhoods for her pilot and sends the map in a email to her colleague Peter to get input on which neighbourhood might be best suited.\nPeter has some good feedback for Amy, but also gets an idea to try and set up something similar in Vancouver. Peter asks Amy if she can share the code, and Amy sends along the above code snippets. Peter looks up the geographic identifier for Vancouver and subs that in instead of Toronto’s.\n\nlico_yvr <- get_census(\"CA16\",regions=list(CSD=\"5915022\"), vectors=c(lico=\"v_CA16_2573\"),\n                        level=\"CT\",geo_format=\"sf\", quiet=TRUE)\n\nggplot(lico_yvr, aes(fill=(lico/100))) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels=scales::percent) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Children in low income (LICO-AT)\",\n       fill=\"Share\",\n       caption=\"StatCan census 2016\")\n\n\n\n\nEasy peasy, thanks to Amy’s previous work. Peter takes the map to his friend Yuko and asks her for advice where a community-based intervention for low-income children might make sense in Calgary. Yuko asks for the code from Peter to take a closer look herself.\nYuko is interested in a finer geographic breakdown, so she swaps our the geographic level from census tracts to dissemination areas.\n\nlico_yvr_da <- get_census(\"CA16\",regions=list(CSD=\"5915022\"), vectors=c(lico=\"v_CA16_2573\"),\n                        level=\"DA\",geo_format=\"sf\", quiet=TRUE)\n\nggplot(lico_yvr_da, aes(fill=(lico/100))) +\n  geom_sf(size=0.1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels=scales::percent) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Children in low income (LICO-AT)\",\n       fill=\"Share\",\n       caption=\"StatCan census 2016\")\n\n\n\n\nBut then Yuko pauses to think that maybe looking at share of the low income population is not the right metric. She decides to query the number of children in low income (vector “v_CA16_2558”) and prepare the data for a dot-density map.\n\nlibrary(dotdensity)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nlico_dots_yvr <- get_census(\"CA16\",regions=list(CSD=\"5915022\"),geo_format=\"sf\",\n                            vectors=c(lico=\"v_CA16_2558\"), level=\"DA\") %>%\n  compute_dots(\"lico\")\nyvr_city <- get_census(\"CA16\",regions=list(CSD=\"5915022\"),geo_format=\"sf\")\n\nggplot(lico_dots_yvr) +\n  geom_sf(data = yvr_city) +\n  geom_sf(size=0.25,colour=\"brown\",alpha=0.1) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Children in low income (LICO-AT)\",\n       fill=\"Share\",\n       caption=\"StatCan census 2016\")\n\n\n\n\nThat paints a somewhat different picture, and Yuko feels this is much better suited to pinpoint where to best stage a community intervention. She lets Peter and Amy know and emails them her modifications to the code.\nMeanwhile, Yuko’s Vancouver friend Stephanie is looking specifically at children below the age of 6 in low income, and wants to understand how the geographic distribution of low income children has changed over time. Comparing census data through time can be tricky because census geographies change, but this problem has been completely solved via the tongfen R package. Looking at Yuko’s work she thinks it might be best to look at both, the change in share of children in low income as well as the change in absolute number.\n\nlibrary(tongfen)\nmeta <- meta_for_ca_census_vectors(c(total_2006=\"v_CA06_1982\",lico_share_2006=\"v_CA06_1984\",\n                                     lico_2016=\"v_CA16_2561\",lico_share_2016=\"v_CA16_2576\"))\nlico_data <- get_tongfen_ca_census(regions=list(CSD=\"5915022\"),meta,level=\"CT\",quiet = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(lico_2006=total_2006*lico_share_2006/100) %>%\n  mutate(`Absolute change`=lico_2016-lico_2006,\n         `Percentage point change`=lico_share_2016-lico_share_2006)\n\n\nggplot(lico_data,aes(fill=`Absolute change`)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2() +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Change in number of children under 6 in low income\",\n       caption=\"StatCan Census 2006, 2016\")\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(lico_data,aes(fill=`Percentage point change`/100)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(labels=scales::percent) +\n  coord_sf(datum=NA) +\n  labs(title=\"Change in share of children under 6 in low income\",\n       fill=\"Percentage\\npoint change\",\n       caption=\"StatCan Census 2006, 2016\")\n\n\n\n\nStephanie shares her results with Amy in Toronto in case there are components of Amy’s pilot specifically targeting children below 6 in low income.\nMeanwhile Amy has been trying to understand more broadly how the share of low income children has evolved since the 2016 census (using 2015 income data) at the metropolitan level over longer time spans, so she looks through the StatCan socioeconomic tables and settles on table 11-10-0135, which also allows her to compare various low income concepts.\n\nlibrary(cansim)\nmbm_timeline <- get_cansim(\"11-10-0135\") %>%\n  filter(`Persons in low income`==\"Persons under 18 years\",\n         GEO==\"Toronto, Ontario\",\n         Statistics==\"Percentage of persons in low income\")\n\nggplot(mbm_timeline,aes(x=Date,y=val_norm,colour=`Low income lines`)) +\n  geom_point(shape=21) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +\n  labs(title=\"Children in low income in Metro Toronto\",\n       y=\"Share of children in low income\",\n       x=NULL,\n       caption=\"StatCan Table 11-10-0135\")\n\n\n\n\nShe notes that there has been a substantial overall drop in children in low income since 2015 across all measures, which is excellent news. She considers pushing off her pilot project until after the 2021 census data comes out to first understand if the geographic patterns have changed."
