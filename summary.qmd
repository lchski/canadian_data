# Summary

Statistics Canada produces a lot of high quality demographic and economic data for Canada. CMHC complements this with housing data, and municipalities across Canada often provide relevant data through their Open Data portals.

While an introduction to R is part of the goal of this book, we not give a systematic introduction but rather build up skills slowly as we work on concrete examples. It may be beneficial to supplement this with a [more principled introduction to **R** and the **tidyverse**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)**.**

During the course of this book we will make heavy use of several R packages to facilitate data access, in particular.

## The cansim R package

The [**cansim** R package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/) interfaces with the StatCan NDM that replaces the former CANSIM tables. It can be queried for

-   whole tables

-    specific vectors

-   data discovery searching through tables

It encodes the metadata and allows to work with the internal hierarchical structure of the fields.

Larger tables can also be imported into a local SQLite database for reuse across sessions without the need to re-download the data, and better performance when subsetting the data.

## The cancensus R package

The **cancensus** R package interfaces with the CensusMapper API server. It can be queried for

-   census geographies

-   census data

-   hierarchical metadata of census variables

-   some non-census data that comes on census geographies, e.g. T1FF taxfiler data

A slight complication, the [**cancensus** package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/)needs an API key. You can sign up for one on [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/users/sign_up).
