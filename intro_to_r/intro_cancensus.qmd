## The cancensus R package

![](images/cancensus-sticker.png){#cancensus-logo style="float:right;margin-left:3em;" fig-alt="cancensus" width="250"}

The **cancensus** R package interfaces with the CensusMapper API server. It can be queried for

-   census geographies

-   census data

-   hierarchical metadata of census variables

-   some non-census data that comes on census geographies, e.g. T1FF taxfiler data

A slight complication, the [**cancensus** package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/)needs an API key. You can sign up for one on [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/users/sign_up).
