## The cansim R package

The [**cansim** R package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/) interfaces with the StatCan NDM that replaces the former CANSIM tables. It can be queried for

-   whole tables

-   specific vectors

-   data discovery searching through tables

It encodes the metadata and allows to work with the internal hierarchical structure of the fields.

Larger tables can also be imported into a local SQLite database for reuse across sessions without the need to re-download the data, and better performance when subsetting the data.
