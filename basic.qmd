# Basic descriptive analysis

In this section we will look at how to do basic descriptive analysis. The questions we ask here will be quite simple, for example: How has income changed over time? Or: Which areas of Toronto have the highest incomes?

The accompanying analysis won't be very involved, sometimes we will compute percentages or make other simple data manipulations, but generally the analysis will be quite straight-forward. We will focus on how to find data sources that can inform on our question, how to get the data, and how to present and interpret it.
